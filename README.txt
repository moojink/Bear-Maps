Project Overview:
    UC Berkeley CS 61B Project 3 - "Bear Maps v2.0" (Spring 2017, Prof. Josh Hug):
    Using Java to implement the back end of a web mapping application that
    calculates and displays the shortest path to a destination. Front end
    logic is provided by CS 61B staff, and data is obtained from OpenStreetMap.
    The three main parts of the project are...
        1.) "Map Rastering" - Providing the front end with the correct
            set of map images depending on the user's query.
        2.) "Graph Building" - Organizing data extracted from OpenStreetMap
            into a Graph structure with adjacency lists for each node.
        3.) "Route Search" - Implementing the A* search algorithm to calculate
            an optimal route between start and destination.

SCORE: 85.0 / 75.0
  * Awarded extra credit for passing additional test cases for extra features.
  * Graded on Gradescope using UC Berkeley's public autograder.
